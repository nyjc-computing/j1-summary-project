After defeating all the minions, you see the doorway that leads to you and your family’s escape! However, it is blocked by a familiar figure…

“Father?!”

Your father, whom you presumed dead alongside Mother when the soldiers came to the castle, was somehow standing in front of you. His appearance looked ghastly, and it is evident that he had been practising dark magic. You now realise that your family's kidnapping was all orchestrated by him. 

“My downfall is all because of you! If only you hadn’t rejected that royal from another country, we wouldn’t have been destroyed! Now I shall capture you and make you marry them!”

As he transformed into a monster, you know that he is beyond all reason. That royal he mentioned already had someone they loved, but was forced to send a proposal nonetheless to maintain political relationships. When I rejected them, they were actually relieved as they can now pursue their lover. The reason why we were invaded was because their tyrannical leader wanted to unite the empire. How am I supposed to control how they act? 

Regardless, now I have to defeat him so as to escape him.
